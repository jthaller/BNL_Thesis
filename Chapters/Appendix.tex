% Look!  An Appendix!

Appendices are a good idea for almost any thesis.  Your main thesis body will likely contain perhaps 40-60 pages of text and figures.  You may well write a larger document than this, but chances are that some of the information contained therein, while important, does \emph{not} merit a place in the main body of the document.  This sort of content - peripheral clarifying details, computer code, information of use to future students but not critical to understanding your work \ldots - should be allocated to one or several appendices.
