% Chapter 2: XAFS Simulations
% Chapter 2: XANES
\textit{In this section, I can write about XANES to a super in-depth extent, and likely the bulk of this chapter will be about FEFF and FDMNES theoretical calculations}

\section{Maybe derivation of EXAFS Equation}

\section{FEFF vs. FDMNES Approaches}


\section{Theoretical XANES Calculations}
