An explanation of Machine Learning and Neural Networks in general

\section{Autoencoders if they become useful}
Talk about how autoencoders work. Give a nice broad explanation and really go into the math. Include some nice diagrams

Here's \cite{ng2011sparse} a good source to read and model off of. Here \cite{Bhowick2019} is another paper that might be interesting to read. It's about getting noise-free data from the original data using an autoencoder. Neat idea, and could actually be very relevant because they're using geophysical data.
