One-shot learning is arguably the most challenging problem in machine learning \cite{transferlearning3}, and continued work is required to improve the model's ability to predict disorder in experimental spectra. While more time should be dedicated to tuning the hyperparameters and experimenting with different architectures, the approach taken in this thesis---as described in Chapter 4---is by no means the only technique to apply transfer learning. Recent work \cite{meta-learning-orig} \cite{huawei-meta-sgd} \cite{meta-learning2018} on meta learning, the process by which a model learnes to solve many sub-problems and is optimized for learning new problems, offers a promising direction that may be persued. Alternatively, there has been interesting work on few-shot learning for regression problems involving deep embeddings \cite{deepembeddings-few-shot} 

While current limitations in the quantity of experimental data stymie the efforts to complete a model for predicting the mean squared disorder of experimental bulk gold XANES spectra, we present reasonable evidence that bond-length disorder is encoded within the spectra. Further work on transfer learning, improved simulation quality, or a much larger corpus of experimental data may yield the desired predictive capabilities. A succesful neural network capable of predicting bulk gold should in theory be able to learn to predict disorder from other structures via a similar transfer learning process as described in Chapter 4.
