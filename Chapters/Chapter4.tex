Here I expect to showcase lots of nice figures and data to show how well the neural network works

\section{Training with Simulation Data}

    \caption{One version of the neural network has four output nodes: one for MSD, Sigma, Mean, and Kurtosis. Sigma is just the square root of the MSD and was included during training affirm the patterns recognized by the network.}

\end{figure}

\section{Experimental Data} \label{ch:results}
Training the neural network entirely on simulation data and then making predictions on experimental data is unlikely to provide quality results.

    \caption[Experimental Data Interpolation]{The experimental data is measured as a function of different energy values than the ones on which the neural network is trained. Consequently, the experimental spectrum must be mapped onto the proper energy mesh via linear interpolation.}

\subsection{Data Augmentation}
