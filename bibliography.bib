  abstract      = {Autoencoders are neural network formulations where the input and output of the network are identical and the goal is to identify the hidden representation in the provided datasets. Generally, autoencoders project the data nonlinearly onto a lower dimensional hidden space, where the important features get highlighted and interpretation of the data becomes easier. Recent studies have shown that even in the presence of noise in the input data, autoencoders can be trained to reconstruct the noisefree component of the data from the reduced-dimensional hidden space. In this paper, we explore the application of autoencoders within the scope of denoising geophysical datasets using a data-driven methodology. The autoencoder formulation is discussed, and a stacked variant of deep autoencoders is proposed. The proposed method involves locally training the weights first using basic autoencoders, each comprising a single hidden layer. Using these initialized weights as starting points in the optimization model, the full autoencoder network is then trained in the second step. The applicability of denoising autoencoders has been demonstrated on a basic mathematical example and several geophysical examples. For all the cases, autoencoders are found to significantly reduce the noise in the input data.},

  abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D CNNs and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

  abstract = {A software package for the analysis of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data is presented. This package is based on the IFEFFIT library of numerical and XAS algorithms and is written in the Perl programming language using the Perl/Tk graphics toolkit. The programs described here are: (i) ATHENA, a program for XAS data processing, (ii) ARTEMIS, a program for EXAFS data analysis using theoretical standards from FEFF and (iii) HEPHAESTUS, a collection of beamline utilities based on tables of atomic absorption data. These programs enable high-quality data analysis that is accessible to novices while still powerful enough to meet the demands of an expert practitioner. The programs run on all major computer platforms and are freely available under the terms of a free software license.},
